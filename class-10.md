# Class 10 notes

Running into errors is inevitable when coding so it's good to know what types of errors there are and the helpful ways you can utilize to resolve them.

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Syntax errors are spelling errors. They cause the program to not run. Logic errors are when the code runs but it's not doing what you intended it to do.
2. An error I've encountered in the past is undefined or a something I'm trying to add a method to is null. I learned that normally means that the variable I'm trying to add the method to is not defined for some reason so then I have to go back to where I thought I defined that and see what's wrong.
3. This topic will make it easier/faster to get through errors in my code because sometimes that can take hours. If I know the different types or errors and what they mean, I can resolve them easier.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. It's a tool built into browsers to help developers see what their program is doing at each line of code and to debug their code if there's problems with it (figure out what's going wrong with it).
2. Breakpoints are a way to pause the code while its executing. It helps because the code typically executes really fast so with breakpoints you can pause it and walk through it line by line and see what's happening while it's executing.
3. From what I understand, the call stack keeps track of the functions and methods that are running currently depending on where you are in your code when you're using the debugger.
