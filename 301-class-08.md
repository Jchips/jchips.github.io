# Reading notes 8

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2. REST APIs are designed around a resource which is an object, data, or service that the client can access.
3. An identifier of a resource is a URI (a link) that is unique to whatever the client is trying to access. An example of a URI that [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) used is: <https://adventure-works.com/orders/1>
4. The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
5. The URIs should be based on whatever is being accessed. They should be based on the resources (nouns).
6. This same example from before is an example of a good URI <https://adventure-works.com/orders>
7. A chatty web API is one that has a lot of requests so does a lot of loading. It has a lot of resources. It is NOT a good thing.
8. GET requests return a status code of 200 if they are successful.
9. An unsuccessful GET request returns a status code of 404 (the resource cannot be found). If the request was fulfilled but there is no response body, then the GET request returns a status code of 204.
10. A successful POST request returns a status code of 201. If there is no result to return, the method can return the status code of 204 (no content).
11. A successful DELETE request returns a status code of 204 (no content).

## Thing I want to know more about

1. How exactly do I know when to use an async function? I know it has something to do with promises... Is it whenever I want to receive something from a server?
2. I think we might be learning this later, but if my server is on localhost, then what happens when I turn my server off? Then no one else can access it? I'm curious how to keep the server running non-locally then.
