# Reading Notes 13

This topic is important for understanding building APIs and working with data from databases.

## CRUD Basics

1. You would use PUT or PATCH methods to update a record through an API
2. Both the above methods and the DELETE method require an ID parameter.

## Buiding a CRUD API

1. The relationship between REST and CRUD are that you use the REST HTTP methods to perform the CRUD commands.
2. My 5 steps to creating a RESTful API would be:
    1. Creating the project
    2. Fetching the data and displaying it to a user with a GET request
    3. Building the functionality for the user to add new data with a POST request
    4. Building the functionality for the user to update the data with a PUT or PATCH request.
    5. Building the functionality for the user to delete data with a DELETE request.
