# Reading notes 3

These are useful tools for coding in React, especially with using components.

## Lists and keys

1. .map() returns a new array with the changes made from the original one.
2. There are multiple ways to iterate over an array in JSX in React. You can use a forEach() method or the map() method.
3. Each list item needs a unique key.
4. A key is useful for accessing an individual list item. It is a unique identifier. It is like an id in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## The Spread Operator

1. The spread operator is three dots (...) that can be used to turn elements in an object into separate arguments for using methods.
2. The spread operator can spread array elements into different arguments when using arguments. For example:

```javascript

Math.max([1, 2, 3])) // returns 3

```

It can also be used for copying arrays, concatenating arrays, adding items to arrays, adding to state in React, and several other things.
3. Concatenating arrays example:

```javascript
let cows = ['🐮'];
let moreCows = ['🐄', '🐄'];
let cowsArray = [...cows, ...moreCows]; 
console.log(cowsArray) // output ['🐮', '🐄', '🐄']
```

4. Adding item to array example:

```javascript
let cows = ['cows'];
let moreCows = ['🐮', ...cows]; 
console.log(moreCows) // output [ '🐮', 'cows' ]
```

5. Combining two objects example:

```javascript
const phone1 = {apple: 'iphone'};
const phone2 = {samsung: 'galaxy'};
const phones = {...phone1, ...phone2};
console.log(phones) // output { apple: 'iphone', samsung: 'galaxy' }
```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

1. The first step to pass functions between components is to create a function in the parent.js that you want to pass to the child.
2. The increment function takes in a name and then increments the count for the Person component that has that name as a prop.
3. You can pass a method from a parent component into a child component by passing the method as a prop to the child component.
4. The child component invokes the method passed to it by invoking the prop for the function. For example,

```javascript
this.props.increment();
```
