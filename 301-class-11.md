This topic is important for better understanding our introduction to databases.

## nosql vs sql

### 5 differences between SQL and NoSQL (Source: thegeekstuff.com)

1. SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases. NoSQL databases are called non-relational (or distributed databases).
2. SQL databases are table-based and NoSQL databases are document based with key-value pairs, documents, graph databases, or wide-column stores.
3. SQL databases have predefined schema and NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data (whatever that means).
4. SQL databases are vertically scalable and NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
5. SQL databases use SQL for defining and manipulating the data. NoSQL databases' queries are focused on the collection of documents.

## NoSQL vs SQL

1. Complex queries are a good fit for a SQL database. They are not the best fit for hierarchical data storage.
2. A real-life example of the above is a customer's table. The columns would be, for instance, customer_id, name, email, address, phone_number. (source: ChatGPT)
3. NoSQL databases are a good fit for hierarchical data storage.
4. An real-world example of this is unstructured data for instance social media feeds and user profiles. (source: ChatGPT).
5. NoSQL databases are better for hierarchical data storage.
6. From what I understood, I think NoSQL databases are better for scalability.

## NoSQL vs SQL video

1. SQL stands for "Structured Query Language". It's not a database, it's a language.
2. A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns, where the relationships between the tables are defined through keys.
3. Relational databases worked with SQL (Structured Query Language).
4. A schema is like a blueprint that the data follows. It defines the organization and layout of the data. It defines the logical and physical structure of the database and provides a framework for organizing and representing the data.
5. A NoSQL database is a non-relational database.
6. NoSQL databases handle unstructured data by using documents and key-value pairs.
7. Inside a MongoDB database, the data is organized into collections. A collection in MongoDB is analogous to a table in a relational database. However, unlike tables, collections do not enforce a predefined schema across all documents (records) within the collection. This flexibility allows documents within a collection to have different structures, making MongoDB a document-oriented NoSQL database.
8. MongoDB is more flexible than a SQL database because of its unstructured environment. It does not force the same schema for all its documents within the collection.
9. A disadvantage of NoSQL databases is the lack of standardization. Unlike SQL databases, which adhere to a standardized query language (SQL), NoSQL databases lack a uniform standard across different implementations. Each NoSQL database may have its own query language, API, and data modeling approach. This can make it more challenging to switch between different NoSQL databases or work with multiple NoSQL databases simultaneously.
