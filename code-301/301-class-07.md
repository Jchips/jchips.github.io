# Reading Notes 7

Node.js is important to know because we have already been using npm so it's good to actually know what it is, and I assume we will be using Node.js for our server-side programming.

## An Intro to Node.js

1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime which means it's a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. We can build server-side applications with it. (source: <https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js>)
2. From what I understand, Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine is something that compiles our JavaScript code into something the computer can read and execute.
3. According to ChatGPT, "In the context of JavaScript, a "runtime" refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is executed."
4. npm is a package manager that belongs to Node.js that allows developers to install and uninstall packages (third-party libraries and modules) to their projects and computers.
5. I'm running Node.js v19.7.0
6. I'm running npm 9.5.0
7. To install jshint, run ```npm install -g jshint```
8. Node.js is used for running JavaScript on the server.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. The 6 reasons for pair programming are:
    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness
2. In my experience, the engaged collaboration and the learning from fellow students are the most beneficial for me when doing pair programming.
3. Pair programming works by one person is the driver (types the code) and the other person is the navigator who gives most of the ideas. Then after a while, you switch so that both people get a turn doing each job.
