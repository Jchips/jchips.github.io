# Reading Notes 10

## Understanding the Javascript call stack

1. A call is when you invoke a function. Ex: addNums() (calls the addNums() function).
2. One call happens at a time.
3. LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. It means that the last function that gets added to the call stack is the first one that comes out (gets called). Example on: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4>
4. Example of call stack: ![Example of call stack](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/QgR2uIk7tW0YNz0Xm8g0jAPeRFI0e4sCejsv) Img by: [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Stacks%20and%20Queues/Stacks%20and%20Queues.html).
5. A stack overflow happens when you call a function instead of itself (recursive function) without any breakpoints. It creates a continuous loop. ex:

```javascript
function callMyself(){
  callMyself();
}

callMyself();
```

## JavaScript error messages

1. A reference error is when you try to call something that is not defined
2. A syntax error is when something can't be parsed or read by the computer. It's like missing a curly bracket I think.
3. A range error is when you try to get a value that doesn't exist in something like an object or array that has the length method. Example from <https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c>:

    ```javascript
    var foo= []
    foo.length = foo.length -1 // Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length
    ```

4. A type error is when you try to use or access data types with incompatible types, like adding a number to something with the type of 'undefined'.
5. A breakpoint is a spot where the program will pause its execution. Users can add breakpoints in their code to debug their code.
6. A debugger statement is how you create a breakpoint. From my understanding, you just put ```debugger;``` in your code where you want the breakpoint to be.
