# Reading notes 4

These topics extend our React arsenal for functionality we can put in our React apps.

## React Forms

1. A controlled component is when you change the component's state after the user changes/inputs something on the page.

2. I think we should wait to store the user's response when they submit it because that's the user's final submission and we can make things on our page change based on that.

3. We can target what the user is entering using setState to change the state after the user submits something.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. We would use a ternary operator to do a conditional on one line and when there is something we want to be done if the result equals true and something else done if the result equals false. Ternary operators work in the render method return() part in React.

2. x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)

## Things I want to know more about

I'm curious if we will learn about React routing for having multiple pages (like a navbar) in a React site.

I'm also curious if we will learn about doing some mobile development in React at some point.
