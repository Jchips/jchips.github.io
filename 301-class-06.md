# Reading Notes 6

This topic matters because it's important to understanding APIs. We will be making requests with APIs to get information on the web.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Roy Fielding helped make the first web servers and HTTP protocol.
2. The techniques that we use in this class don't work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world because we use a local network for a certain geographical area that we are surrounded in.
3. HTTP is basically the foundation of the web. It can get the location of anything on the web.
4. A GET request gets stuff on the web through a URL.
5. A POST request is for adding something from one system to another system
6. A PUT request is for replacing something in another system.
7. A PATCH request is for doing a partial update.

I got all my API keys.

## Things I want to know more about

* I couldn't really find the answer to the second question in the article given so I kind of had to guess. So, I guess I'm curious what the real answer is.
