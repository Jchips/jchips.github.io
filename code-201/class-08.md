# Class 8 notes

Flexbox helps make a page look better visually which is important in design. If your page doesn't look appealing, no one will want to use it.

## CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content meaning that you can control elements in one axis: either the row (main axis) or the column (cross axis), but not both at the same time.
2. The main axis is the row. It goes left to right. The cross axis is the column. It goes up and down.
3. The reordering properties of Flexbox can negatively impact accessibility if you are reordering from how elements are displayed in your HTML because screen readers only follow the logical order, not the visual order. They won't regard the CSS changes.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. Float is more limiting than Flexbox. Flexbox just makes little things easier, like centering elements and making different elements equal in size no matter how much content they have in them or how much space is available on the page.
2. Flexbox helps me become a better web developer because it helps me with the design of web pages. Being better at design is one of my software development goals.
