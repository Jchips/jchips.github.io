# Class 6 notes

Understanding objects and the DOM is important in object-orienting programming languages like JavaScript. JavaScript is built upon objects. Objects and the DOM allows us to add functionality to our webpages.

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. An object is something that stores data and functionality. It has properties and functions that can do different things.
2. Object literals are useful when sending a request to a server to put data into a database.
3. It's easier to access the individual items in objects than in arrays because you access them by name instead of index.
4. An example of when you would need to use bracket notation is when you're trying to access a value in an object with a variable name.
5. In the example, ```this.name``` refers to the name property of the dog object ('Spot') and ```this.age``` refers the age property of the dog object (2). The advantage to using ```this``` is because it specifies that the property belongs to the individual object so that you can use it multiple times throughout multiple objects.

## Introduction to the DOM

1. The DOM is the document object model. It makes document structure, style and content accessible to JavaScript so the that the page can be modified and made dynamic. It represents the HTML tags as nodes and objects.
2. JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements (MDN web docs). It's how you can make your webpage more dynamic.
