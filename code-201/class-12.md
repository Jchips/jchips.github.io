# Class 12 notes

These topics are good for exploring functionality with JavaScript.

## JavaScript Canvas

1. The ```<canvas>``` element allows users to draw 2D graphic shapes with JavaScript.
2. You need the closing ```</canvas>``` tag because everything between the two canvas tags becomes fallback content.
3. The ```getContext()``` method returns a render context object. It takes one parameter (the type of context). Ex: ```let context = main.getContext('2d');```

## Chart.js

1. Chart.js is a JavaScript library for making charts. You can install it using npm. I think you can also install it using a CDN link.
2. Some different chart types you can make using chart.js are bar charts, scatter charts, and doughnut and pie charts.

## Create Animated Charts with Chart.js

1. Charts are better to display data with than tables because they are nicer to look at (more user-friendly) and can the data more quickly.
2. Chart.js could aid my past applications by displaying the cookie stand data in a more user-friendly format instead of a table and making other cool visuals that draw in viewers.
