# Class 3 notes

Lists, the box model, arrays, operators, conditionals, and loops are important for adding functionality within our code. They make things more coherent, polished, and efficient.

## Learn HTML

1. Use an unordered list when the items I'm listing don't have a numerical order (the order in the list is meaningless).
2. You can change the bullet style of an unordered list by using the list-style-type property in CSS.
3. Use an ordered list when the items I'm listing have an order to them (the order is meaningful).
4. You can use the type attribute in HTML to change the type of numbering. I think you can also use the list-style-type in property in CSS (?).

## Learn CSS

1. The margin is the outermost layer surrounding the border. It puts whitespace between its box and other elements on the page.
2. The padding is the layer surrounding the content. It puts whitespace between the content and the border.
3. The four parts of the box model are:
    1. content - area where the content is displayed.
    2. padding - layer surrounding the content. It puts whitespace between the content and the border.
    3. border - border surrounding the content. It is between the padding and the margin
    4. margin - the outermost layer surrounding the border. It puts whitespace between its box and other elements on the page.

## Learn JavaScript

1. In arrays, we can store strings, numbers, objects, null and other arrays.
2. I think the people array is a valid JS array. You can access the values using bracket notation. For ex: ```people[0][0]``` should return 'pete' I think.
3. 5 shorthand operators:
    1. ```+=``` adds to x (x = x + num)
    2. ```-=``` subtracts from x (x = x - num)
    3. ```*=``` multiplies to x (x = x * num)
    4. ```&&=``` logical and (x && (x = num)) *[still don't really understand]*
    5. ```||=``` logical or (x || (x = num)) *[still don't really understand]*
4. The result would be '10dog' because the false doesn't add and the 10 is concatenating with the string.
5. A conditional should be used in JS when you want one thing to happen in one case, but a different thing to happen in another case. A real-world example is if the user inputs 'cow' you want to return the word 'moo' but if a user inputs the word 'duck' you want to return 'quack.'
6. A loop is useful if you want the same thing done multiple times in your code. For example, you want to keep asking the user to guess a number until they guess the correct number.

## Things I want to know more about

I don't get the uses for &&= or ||= very much or what a variable using those operators would evaluate to.
