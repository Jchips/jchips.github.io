This topic is important for learning how to store data on the web without using a server.

## Local Storage On Websites

1. You would want to use local storage on the web when you want to preserve the state of a web application. That way, when you leave it, you can come back to it without it being reset.
2. Personal data that you don't want to be stolen or spied on should not be stored in local storage.
3. Local storage can only store strings but you can use the methods, ```JSON.stringify``` and ```JSON.parse``` to convert information into strings and then parse it back later.
