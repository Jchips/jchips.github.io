# Class 5 notes

The topics here are important for styling and accessibility of a webpage. Good styling and accessibility makes a page more attractive (attracts more viewers).

## HTML Media

1. A real world use case for an ```alt``` attribute is when an image on a page doesn't load but you want the page users to still be able to know what the image contained.
2. To improve accessibility of images you can include an alt tag and a caption tag.
3. An example of when the ```figure``` element could be useful in HTML when you put an image on the page and it's not exactly clear what the image is of or why it's there so you want to put a caption associated with the image.
4. My understanding is that the difference between a gif image is that a gif image can move (animation). They can be used for very short videos. An svg is best for icons or diagrams. They contain source code to draw desired images.
5. For displaying screenshots on a webpage, PNG or WebP is the way to go because of their lossless format. They will maintain the best quality when compressing the image.

## Learn CSS

1. The foreground color of an html element sets the color of text that is in the element while the background color sets the color of the full background of the element (not the text, but the color of whatever the text is sitting on).
2. To help a friend turn a colorless blog into one that has color first I would choose a base color. Then I do color matching to find other colors that fit with the base color well. I would make sure that all text is clearly visible with the colors that I'm using so that it doesn't mess up the accessibility of the page.
3. When using fonts one should consider what fonts are mainly supported on most browsers (the web safe fonts). Also consider whether it's best to use serif or sans-serif font on your page depending on what type of page you're making.
4. The ```font-size``` property changes the size of the font. The ```font-weight``` property changes how bold you what the font to be. The ```font-style``` changes the text into italic or normal (if it is already italic).
5. One way you could add spacing between characters in an h1 element is by using the letter-spacing property in CSS. Another way you could add spacing is by using the font-kerning property in CSS.
