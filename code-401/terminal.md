## Terminal commands

On the Bash command line tutorials site, I learned a number of things. I learned about the difference between absolute paths and relative paths, I learned about options that I can use after commands, and I learned many useful commands. One of my favorites was the ls -a, which lists all the contents of a directory, including hidden files. man was also a command I liked which shows me the manual pages. I can search up commands to see what they do. Moreover, I learned some new handy commands like rmdir - removes a directory, cp - copies a file (directories can be copied with cp -r), mv - moves a files. Can also be used to rename a file, rm - deletes a file.
