# The Growth Mindset

I took the bias and emotional intelligence tests a few months ago. I remember that on the emotional intelligence test, I scored over 18 in everything except relationship management. Lately, I’ve been trying to work on my growth a lot, mainly in my anxiety and mental health. I’ve been trying to do more things out of my comfort zone, and although it’s been pretty difficult for me, I have been able to push myself a bit more recently. I’ve also been trying to be a little more social, so that could improve my relationship management emotional intelligence. I know I want to grow in many areas, so I’ve been trying hard this past year to make that growth happen. It’s not a fast process, but I’m trying to be proud of myself for continuing to try.
