# Reading Notes 14

This will help me practice my event skills that I just learned so that I can utilize them in future projects.

## Mini project ideas

1. An auction where a client offers an item at a (random) price and then buyers bid on it. Everytime the price goes up the client is notified and the previous bidder who was on top is notified too. After a certain amount of time (30 secs) the item is sold at the highest bidder's price.
2. A basic chat application where a messenger sends a message and then a recipient responds.

## Reflection

My learning goal is to complete a mini project that showcases what I've learned from the events and Socket.IO classes.
