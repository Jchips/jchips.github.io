# Reading Notes 9

In this lab, I get practice building a REST API that uses auth using Postgres.

## Project ideas

1. Social media app API where users login and then can view posts. People who haven't logged in can only view posts. People who have logged in can view, post, and edit posts. Admins can delete accounts and view all users.

2. A surveys API where users login and then recieve surveys that are posted. They fill them out and the people who sent the surveys can review them. Only the creators of the surveys can view all the responses they got from multiple people.

## Reflection

My learning goal is to build a REST API and Auth server with Postgres all from scratch.
