# Reading notes 1

It's important to know what Node.js is because we have been using it for server-side programming in past courses and will continue using it in the future.

## An Introduction to Node.js on Sitepoint

1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime which means it's a program we can use to execute JavaScript (a coding language) on our computers. It can compile JavaScript code into code that our computers can understand. (source: <https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js>).
2. A "runtime" refers to the environment in which JavaScript code is executed." (source: ChatGPT). So, Node.js can be used to execute JavaScript code.
3. Node.js is used for installing and running build tools for JavaScript projects. You can install build tools using npm or yarn. Node is also used as an environment for running apps with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue. Furthermore, Node is used for running JavaScript on the server.

## Additional Questions

1. For this 1st module, I look forward to exploring Node.js more. I am anxious about learning Big O because I've had a couple college classes that tried to teach me it but I could never really grasp it. I hear it's very important for performance and efficiency though.
2. My learning goal is to be able to understand and execute all the learning objectives for this class. It looks like a lot and might be harder for me now that the classes won't be live for me anymore, but I will take good notes and hopefully, I can feel like I have a beginner's understanding of everything being taught by the end.
