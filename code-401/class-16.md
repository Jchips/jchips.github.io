# Reading Notes 16: AWS: Cloud Servers

This topic is important because AWS is commonly used and is a great asset to know how to use.

## AWS EC2

What is an EC2 Instance?

- A EC2 instance is a virtual server that runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
- "EC2 instances are fundamental building blocks of AWS cloud computing services, enabling users to deploy and manage applications, host websites, perform data processing tasks, and run various workloads efficiently and cost-effectively. They offer flexibility, scalability, and reliability, making them a popular choice for a wide range of computing needs." ~ ChatGPT.

Name 2 use cases for EC2.

- Some use cases for EC2 are web hosting, developing for Apple platforms, data processing and analysis.

Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.

- A reason to use ECS (Elastic Container Service) instead of the listed services above is for the AWS ecosystem. ECS has seamless integration with other AWS services.

## EC2 For Humans

Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?

- Under the compute section. Clicking EC2 will take you to the EC2 console.

Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.

- A T2 Micro virtual server instance is for lightweight work. It offers low to moderate CPU, network performance, and memory and is the cheapest compared to XL instances.
- A XL virtual server instance is more suitable for large-scale applications and demanding workloads. It has high-performing CPU and network performance, lots of memory and is more expensive than a T2 Micro instance.

Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.

- A compute cycle is the cycle it takes to do something like displaying something on a screen or open a program. It's a tiny step in a bigger process.

## Elastic Beanstalk

What is Elastic Beanstalk?

- A service to host web applications. It deploys, manages, and scales web applications and services for you.

Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.

- Elastic Beanstalk makes virtual servers using AWS EC2.

Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.

- You don't have to spend a lot of time managing and configuring infrastructure.
- Quick and simple to get started.
- You can tweak the resource
- No additional charge. Only charges are for AWS resources to store and run your applications.

## Additional Questions

1. I look forward to learning how to use AWS with NodeJS and work with S3 and Lambda.
2. My learning goals are to learn and understand how to use Elastic Beanstalk to Deploy a NodeJS server to an EC2 instance at AWS.
