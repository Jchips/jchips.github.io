# Reading notes 1

Components and props are like the roots of React. They are key concepts to learn when learning how to use React.

## Component-Based Architecture

1. A component is a reusable, replaceable part the of code that can interact with other components in a one-way flow.

2. The characteristics of a component are reusability, replaceable, not context-specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent.

3. Some advantages to using component-based architecture are that components are reusable, they help keep the code more DRY, they are independent, it makes the code more reliable because of the reliability of each component, and they can reduce cost.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. "Props" is short for "properties".

2. In React, props are used for passing data from a parent component to a child component. They can't be passed in the opposite way.

3. Props have a one-directional flow, meaning they can't be passed from the child component to the parent component and they can't be passed from one child component to another.
