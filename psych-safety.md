# Psychological Safety

This topic is useful for succeeding in groups. Collaborating is something that happens a lot in the coding field so learning ways to get along in groups and do good group work is very important.

1. 3 key factors that contribute to psychological safe teams are:
    1. The team will not reject, punish or make fun of other people for their ideas.
    2. Having clear goals as a team and having everyone be dependable.
    3. Taking turns in conversation and having empathy for one another.
2. I can't remember anything from any of my jobs, but in high school, I remember being in a project group where we made sure everyone was involved in the project and gave a chance for everyone to pitch ideas. We brainstormed ideas for our project at a park so it felt less stressful and more fun and comfortable. Although, there ended up being an imbalance in the amount of work everyone put in even though we all gave each other an equal opportunity to contribute and listened to each other's ideas.
3. Everyone feels more comfortable and the group can create better bonds with each other which can be useful for things outside of the project. Moreover, it lessens the stress.
