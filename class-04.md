# Class 4 notes

The topics matter because links are important for navigation through a site, positioning helps make a page look like how we want it to, and functions are commonly used, not only in JS but in almost all programming languages particularly to make code more DRY.

## Learn HTML

1. We wrap text inside an anchor element ```<a>``` when creating a link.
2. Inside the ```href``` attribute in the ```<a></a>``` tag goes the link we want the user to have access to
3. To make links more accessible to users, we can use clear link wording. User descriptive link text.

## CSS Layout

1. Normal flow is how the page looks without adding any CSS to the page.
2. Block-level elements take up the whole width while inline elements only take up the space of its content. Inline elements are displayed next to each other on a page while block-level elements sit on top of each other. You can't change the width or height of inline elements.
3. Static positioning is the default positioning for every HTML element.
4. With absolute positioning the element doesn't regard the normal document flow, it is on its own layer. It ignores its sibling elements and only regards the parent element if the parent element's positioning is not static. With absolute positioning, you can create UI features that don't interfere with other elements on the page, such as popups.
5. A key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed only regards the body element but absolute can regard its parent element if that element is not static. The fixed positioning makes it so that the element is always visible when you scroll through the page.

## Learn JS

1. A function declaration is I think when you create or define a function. A function invocation is when you call the function to run it. It's how you use a function after it has been defined.
2. I think a parameter is what is included inside the function parentheses when you declare it. You can use what you put in the parentheses inside the function. An argument is what goes in the function's parentheses when you call it.

## Miscellaneous

1. One benefit of pair programming is learning from peers. Everyone is different and approaches things uniquely and that can help me look at problems in different ways. Another benefit is improving social skills. My social skills aren't great, I'm pretty shy, awkward, and just agreeable while not very assertive or good at talking.
