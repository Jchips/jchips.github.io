# Reading Notes 5

## React Docs - Thinking in React

1. The single responsibility principle is that each component should only do one thing and, if it ends up doing more than one thing, another subcomponent should be made.
2. A static version of your app is basically a version without using state. You still use props and components, but no interactivity features (data that changes over time).
3. After building the static application, you add interactivity (state).
4. These are 3 questions to ask yourself to determine whether your project is static or not (from React.dev):
    * Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn't state.
    * Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
    * Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!
5. Here are tips from [React.dev](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) to identify where to put state in your application:
    1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
    2. Find their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy.
    3. Decide where the state should live:
        * Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
        * You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
        * If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.

## Higher-Order Functions

1. Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them are higher-order functions.
2. In the [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK) article, the code on line 2 is returning a new function that compares whether m is greater than n (m is the argument of the new function).
3. The map() method is a higher-order function I believe because it is a function that executes an inner function on every element in an object.
