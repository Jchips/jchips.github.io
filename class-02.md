# Class 2 notes

HTML, JavaScript and CSS are the main web development languages.

## intro to HTML

1. Semantic elements have several benefits such as search engines will consider its contents as important keywords in the pageâ€™s search rankings, screen readers will use to help visually impaired people, and it helps organize the page contents so other developers can read/understand it easier.
2. There 6 levels of headings in HTML
3. Uses for the \<sup> tag include: making some letters higher than others (superscript). Uses for the \<sub> tag include: making some letters lower than others (subscript).

    Example from mdn:

    "My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.
    Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3."

4. When using the abbreviation tag ```<abbr>```, you put the 'title' attribute to provide the full expansion of the term.

## Learn CSS

1. We can apply CSS to our HTML using the ```href``` attribute of the ```<link>``` tag.
2. We should avoid using inline styles bc of the separation of concerns. It is best practice to keep the different languages seperate.
3. Review the block of code below...
    1. h1 is the selector
    2. I think the whole block of code is the declaration.
    3. The 'color' and the 'padding' are the properties and what they are set to are the values.

## Learn JS

1. A string is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks
2. 4 types of JavaScript operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), assignment (=), strict equality (===)
3. If you need to do something multiple times, you can run a function. For instance, everytime you wanna braid your hair, run a braidHair() function....

### Conditionals

1. An if statement checks an condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
2. An else if statement is for evaluating a different condition than the one above.
3. 3 different types of comparison operators: ===, !==, <, >, <=, =>.
4. && means 'and' and || means 'or'
